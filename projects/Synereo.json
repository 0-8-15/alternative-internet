    "description": "[Synereo](http://www.synereo.com/) is an open source, decentralized **social network**. It is an **attention economy** that rewards popular content and participation with crypto-currency. Content is promoted or advertised in a way that fairly rewards the content's creator and those who choose to engage with that content. An automatic and transparent **reputation economy** assures that you experience content relevant to you. The privacy of your communications and contacts is baked-in to the structure of the network. Synereo is modeled in [Ï€-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus) and functionally programmed in Scala.",
